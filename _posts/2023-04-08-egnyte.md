Deploying the Egnyte desktop app can be a challenge for IT Administrators when they want to add more than one drive or have the drives be added with permissions.


That's where my collection of PowerShell scripts comes in handy. It works with both Active Directory and Intune deployments. It utilizes a common CSV file to determine which drives should be mapped, how they should be mapped, and what permissions they require.

There are two sets of scripts, one for Active Directory and another for Intune. Detailed instructions for setting up and configuring the scripts are available under the wiki.
